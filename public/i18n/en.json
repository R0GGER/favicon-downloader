          "question": "What if a website doesn't have a favicon?",
          "answer": "If FaviconExtractor can't find a favicon for a website, it doesn't just leave you empty-handed. Instead, it automatically generates a custom SVG icon using the first letter of the domain name. This ensures that you always get a usable icon, even when a website hasn't set up their own favicon. Here's what happens:\n\n1. FaviconExtractor searches for the website's favicon.\n2. If no favicon is found, it creates a simple, attractive SVG icon.\n3. The SVG icon features the first letter of the domain name.\n4. This generated icon is then available for download and use, just like a regular favicon.\n\nThis feature is particularly useful for:\n- Placeholder icons while you're developing a website\n- Maintaining a consistent look in your bookmarks or applications, even for sites without favicons\n- Quickly creating simple letter-based icons for various purposes\n\nRemember, while this generated icon is free to use, it's always best to create a custom favicon for your own websites to enhance brand recognition and user experience."

          "answer": "FaviconExtractor dynamically checks for all available favicon sizes on a given website. The sizes can range from 16x16 pixels up to 512x512 pixels or even larger, depending on what the website offers.\n"

        "qa4": {
          "question": "Can I use the favicons I download for my own website?",
          "answer": "While FaviconExtractor makes it easy to download favicons, it's important to respect copyright laws. The favicons you download are typically owned by their respective websites. If you're using a downloaded favicon for anything other than personal reference, make sure you have permission from the original website owner.\n\n"

        "qa5": {
          "question": "Can I check multiple websites at once?",
          "answer": "Currently, FaviconExtractor checks one website at a time. For bulk checks, you'll need to enter each domain separately.\n"
